    """Read a MeasurementSet (MSv2 format) into a next generation CASA
    dataset (visibilities dataset as a set of Xarray datasets).

    The MS is partitioned into multiple sub- Xarray datasets (where the data variables are read as
    Dask delayed arrays).
    The MS is partitioned by DDI, which guarantees a fixed data shape per partition (in terms of channels
    and polarizations) and, subject to experimentation, by scan and subscan. This results in multiple
    partitions as xarray datasets (xds) contained within a main xds (mxds).

    :param infile: Input MS filename
    :param subtables: Also read and include subtables along with main table selection. Default False will
    omit subtables (faster)
    :param asdm_subtables: in addition to MeasurementSet subtables (if enabled), also read extension
    subtables named "ASDM_*"
    :param partition_scheme: (experimenting) Whether to partition sub-xds datasets by scan/subscan
    (in addition to DDI), or other alternative partitioning schemes. Accepted values: 'scan/subscan',
    'scan', 'ddi', 'intent'. Default: 'intent'
    :param chunks: Can be used to set a specific chunk shape (with a tuple of ints), or to control the
    optimization used for automatic chunking (with a list of ints). A tuple of ints in the form of (row,
    chan, pol) will use a fixed chunk shape. A list or numpy array of ints in the form of [idx1, etc]
    will trigger auto-chunking optimized for the given indices, with row=0, chan=1, pol=2. Default None
    uses auto-chunking with a best fit across all dimensions (probably sub-optimal for most cases).
    :param expand: (to be removed) Whether or not to return the original flat row structure of the MS (False)
    or expand the rows to time x baseline dimensions (True). Expanding the rows allows for easier indexing
    and parallelization across time and baseline dimensions, at the cost of some conversion time. Default
    False
    :param **kwargs: (to be removed?) Selection parameters from the standard way of making CASA MS
    selections. Supported keys are: spw, field, scan, baseline, time, scanintent, uvdist, polarization,
    array, observation.  Values are strings.
