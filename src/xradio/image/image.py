                   Supported optional keys are 'l', 'm', 'frequency', 'polarization',
                   and 'time'. The supported values are positive integers,
                   indicating the length of a chunk on that particular axis. If
                   a key is missing, then the associated chunk length along that axis
                   is equal to the number of pixels along that axis.

                   used to store the arrays in the zarr image is used.
                   'l' represents the longitude like dimension, and 'm'
                   represents the latitude like dimension. For apeature images,
